2. Reminders for upcoming deadlines

# Anything we can do to make it clear which IO's have been accepted and which IO's haven't will help AC's a ton!!

## General notes
- RFP submission CC emails AM's feedback on out of office replies, or if someone is not longer working there
- Activity feed would need to be filtered somehow for larger agencies
-- Activity items from RFP process could crowd a CA's activity feed making it harder to find relevant feed items. Same for an AM with a CA stage feed items

- Info priority on an alert item: 
Event -> Campaign -> Partner -> Time
-- IO accepted for [Campaign name]
Accepted by [User] at [Partner] on 7/1/2013 10:11 am

- Budget/Total from Proposals labels should be Target Budget/Current Budget
