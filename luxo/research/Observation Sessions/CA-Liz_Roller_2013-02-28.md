# Observation Session
- February 28, 2013
- Liz Roller (CA) (Session 3)
- Conducted by Dave Castleton


# Take-aways
________________________________________________________________

- Reporting involves multiple systems
-- Varies between clients
-- I Need a better understanding of this process
- Dashboard view should be roll specific
-- "I don't hate the dashboard, it's just not reliable."
-- CA's look at Live, less at Pending
-- CM's look at Pending, less at Live
- Notes are very useful, but unreliable 


# General observations
________________________________________________________________

## Dashboard columns 
- MMS dashboard has information that CA's don't look
- Items CA could eliminate:
-- Check boxes
--- CA's don't need to see exact stage it's in for pending
--- Looks at pending campaigns sometimes because a campaign will be half-live, but doesn't need to see the exact check box stages
--- A lot of times search campaigns are purely measured by "click pacing"
-- Revenue
--- What's delivered to date, how much we will bill the agency/client
--- Doesn't look at revenue a lot
--- Uses this to determine which campaign has higher priority
--- Not as concerned with exact dollar amount
--- More concerned about revenue in context of other campaigns
--- If under $10,000 we don't send the client anything
-- Probably better to look at est. lost (in Insight) rather than revenue total
--- Allows her to see how much we're actually losing if we don't deliver this campaign in full
--- Liked the option to be able to select columns (like ad words)

- Suggestions for data points to add to MMS dash: 
-- Doesn't feel like there is a lot to add
-- Feels like it's already too crowded
- Usually the additional data she's looking for gets pulled directly from MediaMind (conversion data) 
- "I don't hate the dashboard, it's just not reliable."

## Notes:
- Doesn't care if other people see her notes
- It's actually helpful to see other people's notes
- Doesn't use notes section in MMS dashboard because she's afraid others will erase it
- If she puts something in there that she really needs to remember, it might get erased because they can only put one note in at a time

## Pentaho
- Pull report for monthly
- Used more by AE
- Can pull historical data
- Takes a lot of time to compile reports, slow

## MediaMind reports
- Sometime the don't come in until late in the day 
- Didn't come in until 7pm the other day, so CA's just sit around
- Trying to move to Dart

## Campaign analysis ownership
- If campaign needs extensive delivery reporting, CA's owns it
- If client only needs basic reporting (impressions, clicks and pacing) AC's will handle it

## Client reports:
- Clients don't refer to campaigns the way we do
- They refer to it by campaign name 
-- South Dakota Department of Tourism = SDPEAK001
-- Have to click on Campaign-->Plan details to get a name the client will recognize when creating reports or sending emails



# Task observations
________________________________________________________________

## Mapping (Insight v. MMS process)
- Insight has eliminated a lot of steps for uploading performance data
- The Campaign Report Upload Confirmation page in MMS isn't very useful to Liz
-- She can always un-map something if it's wrong
- Un-mapping in MMS is a hassle
-- You have to un-map all tags to clear the data and re-map all tags even if you only need to change on tag
- Like Insight's manual process is much better
-- Being able to remove one tag and having the placement data update is great
- For Auto-upload and mapping in Insight
-- If it can match placements with tags, it will auto-map
--- Doesn't find many matches
-- Of the matches it does find, the mapping is usually incorrect
-- If she un-maps the incorrect mapping and manually maps the correct tag, the auto-mapping overrides the change

 
## Placements ending in 7 days report
- Comes via email
- Is CA specific
- Used to be helpful to see what you were dealing with when you had 200+ campaigns
- Less useful now that the CA workload is smaller
- Usually already know what is going to expire



# Additional questions	
________________________________________________________________
- Need a comprehensive look into reporting.  Who reports what to whom? What applications are involved when compiling reports?  If we only start with one, what does that MVP report look like? (Liz is compiling an example.)

- Actualizing data is complicated/pain--need more explanation around this.
