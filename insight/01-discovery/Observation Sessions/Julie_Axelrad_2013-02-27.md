## Subheader
- Opens MMS dashboard
- Second tab for RAW reports to get reports faster
- Opens MediaMind
-- Management campaigns have been divided 
-- If campaign in MediaMind, it gets kicked over to a CA
-- They can get more data
-- If a client has an ad server, usually they have analysts on there side, then just an AC handles the data
-- MediaMind is the ad server we use for more full-service clients

- Starts with her MMS dashboard
- Doesn't use the spreadsheet because OFA started it was the only thing she was doing, it went
- Doesn't know if she was using it just because everybody else was using it
- But with the smaller load, MMS dashboard has been working really well
- Liked it in the beginning because of having more notes, but now that she is more familiar with it it she just uses the notes field 
- Using notes to tell how often, what day of the week, and the actual date
- Additional notes about things that she needs to do with the client
- Depending on the stage, CA/CM use the note (e.g. Pending v. Live)
- If you put your initials by the note, it's less likely that someone will delete it
- One field that's missing from MMS owners is the AC
- Became more complicated when they broke out campaign ownership based on MediaMind or not (AC v. CA)

- Add people in the Plan Details section of MMS
- Because not field for AC on dashboard, they put the AC in the notes

- Tends to have larger campaigns but a smaller number
- Has around 15 campaigns
- Has had up to 70
- Depends on time of year and size of campaign

- When at Dashboard, filters by next report date
- What's on schedule for me to update today
- Pain point-
-- Set next report date on campaign report upload confirmation page, the format is different (xx/xx/xxxx) vs. changing the report date on the dashboard (xx/xx/xx)
-- This causes the dates to sort incorrectly 
-- when you have a lot of campaigns, this is a hassle to scroll and find what you're looking for

- On dashboard, it would be good to have more than just pacing
-- CA-doesn't look at Approve/revised date, Site count, finds it more helpful in pending status-when she sees a new campaign on her dash it good to see once to see size, might be useful for coordinators because they have to send an email per site, so they could sort by # of sites for them to prioritize their work load
- Add CTR, Conversion rates is they have it

- Annoying to have to pull reports to see information for (CTR, Conversion rate), Sales people might ask for it and it sucks to pull for just those metrics

- Checkboxs seem more important in pending
- By the time CA gets the campaign, they know it's live 
- CA's check final report box when the campaign is fully update and we've talked to the client and good for billing, click the box, then finance can start working on it

- If campaign is pending, they will look at the boxes, to see why a campaign hasn't started yet

- Custom reports
-- Created for clients 
-- Taking basic download client report for MMS and creating pivotable and other charts or graphs to highlight performance levels
-- If they want to do more than that, they have to go into MediaMind (ad server) gives you more advanced data
- Report should be the same per week for the advertiser
- Most of the legwork comes on the front end to build the report, once they are built they can save the reports format

- Julie works campaign by campaign
- Does it this way because it helps her stay organized to make sure each campaign gets each step of the process
- Prioritizes the campaign order by what of day the reports needs to go out, 
- General performance issues, especially if the client is upset about performance
- Will do as much as she can at one point, comes up with some ideas, will hold onto report until account team are available 
- This requires more strategy about how to fix the poor performance

- Some publishers, we can't use 3-party tracking so we have to reach out to publisher to get performance data
- she'll make notes about which ones have to go through this manual process
- She'll first email those site and wait for the data to come over and get started on other campaigns until the data comes in
- Mobile is another area that 3-party ad serving doesn't really work

- Use RAW Reports 
- Auto upload in insight for analysts should be almost 100% because of the way they determine campaign ownership (AC/CA)

- Insight
- Building a custom report is all done through excel
- A custom report builder where you could pull any campaign by any placement, ad size, basically everything you can do in excel
- Pull into a table and create a graph, that would be amazing
- more or less what we do in excel it would really speed things up
- And be able to download a PDF version 
- When we email clients formatting gets screwed up
- Right download ad server and combine with MMS data
