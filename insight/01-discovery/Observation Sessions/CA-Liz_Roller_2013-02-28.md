- Actualizing data is complicated/pain


________________________________________________________________

1. Does Insight auto map or just auto upload tags?
- Supposed to do both
- Auto mapping overrides manual changes 
- Insight has eliminated a lot of step for uploading data
- The confirm --> save page in MMS doesn't seem useful
-- You can always go in an change things if it's wrong
- Being able to remove one tag and having the placement data updates (this doesn't happen in MMS, you have to unmap all the tags and remap to get the delivery data to update)


2. Even if auto(--), will you still need a way to verify what has been done and confirm it?

3. What reports do you download?
4. What is the process for each report?

5. Analysis process?  When do you do it? What's involved?

6. Do you need to see tags on the campaign detail page of Insight (currently can see them on Campaign details in MMS)
- Might look at tags on right to see if all sizes are delivering

7. Delete:
- Check boxes
-- don't care what stage it's in for pending
-- But sometimes I look at pending because a campaign will be half-live, but doesn't need to see the check box stages
-- A lot of times search is done by click pacing
-- Doesn't look at revenue a lot
-- Revenue - uses this to determine which campaign has higher priority, not as concerned with dollar amount but is concerned about revenue in context of other campaigns
-- If under $10,000 we don't send the client anything
-- Revenue is what's delivered to date, how much we will bill the agency/client
-- Probably better to look at est. lost (in Insight) rather than revenue total, because then I know how much we are actually losing if we don't deliver this campaign in full
-- Liked the option to be able to select columns (like ad words)

Add: 
- Doesn't feel like there is a lot 
- Usually it's more working out of media mind and pulling conversion data
- "I don't hate the dashboard, it's just not reliable."

Client reports:
- Clients don't refer to campaigns the way we do (by campaign name)
- The use full names--to get the full name you have to go into campaign-->plan details

- Notes:
-- Doesn't use comments because she's afraid others will erase it
-- Doesn't care if someone sees her notes, just is afraid someone else will erase it because you can only put one notes

- Placement ends in 7 report email
-- Used to be helpful to see what you were dealing with when you had 200+ campaigns
-- 

- Pentaho
-- Pull report for monthly
-- Used more by AE
-- Can pull historical data
-- Takes a lot of time

# Download button
- Client report (Liz will send me a report with what would be good)


# MediaMind reports
- Didn't come in until 7pm the other day, so CA's just sit around
- Trying to move to Dart


- Unless it has extensive delivery reporting, then CA's will have it
- if it has a big customer report
- If this is all the client needs Basic reporting (impressions, clicks and pacing)--> then AC's will handle it
