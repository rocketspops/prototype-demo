# Observation Session
- March 5, 2013
- Sean Cleary (CM) (Session 3)
- Conducted by Dave Castleton


# General observations
________________________________________________________________

## Daily delivery reporting format
- DART allows for .CSV format for daily reports
- MediaMind sends Excel files that need to be converted manually to .CSV format

## Creative assets status
- Campaigns where CM is still waiting on creative assets (if hosted w/ MediaMind) or tags (if hosted elsewhere)
- In notes section, Sean adds makes additional notes to clarify
-- "Waiting for creative" (MediaMind)
--- Can still create campaign in MediaMind, just has to wait until they have creative to go live
-- "Waiting for tags" 
--- If the agency is hosting it themselves
--- If no tags, nothing to do but wait


# Task observations
________________________________________________________________

## Building out a proposal-specific custom spec sheet
- Creates custom spec on request from agency
-- Agency needs to know what type of creative assets they need to produce
- Takes media plan proposal from Centro planner
- Creates new tab in Excel and builds out specs
-- Pulls specs from "Centro Ad Specifications" PDF
-- Adds specific notes for each placements 
- Would love it if MMS could generate the specs when the media plan is created
- Once done, deletes proposal tab
-- Doesn't want any sensitive data going out that the advertiser shouldn't see
-- Renames the tab he created
-- Saves as a new document to temp Mapping folder
-- Attaches to email and sends to Account Exec/Manager

## Creating daily delivery report in DART
- A bunch of new campaigns that launched yesterday
- Beginning of the month has a lot more than end of month
- Can have anywhere between 0-20 new campaigns in a day
-- This includes be new campaigns, new flights starting

- Pulling today's campaigns from DART
- Agency emails tags to us (usually) day before
-- Should be 3-5 days before launch
- Sean creates a new folder for each campaign and saves the tags in that folder
- Opens tags in Notepad
- Logs into DART
- Looks for account number in the tags
-- Gets account # from tag 
-- Goes to DART and finds the account number
-- Logs in under agency account number to create new report
- Can't find that specific campaign for a specific set of tags
- Starts working on the other tags
-- Will reach out and tell the advertisers to grant access to that campaign
- Creates delivery report in DART
-- Adds ad server info/creds to campaign in MMS
--- This allows anybody to log into DART and pull the report
-- Schedules the report and then pull it directly
-- Saves .CSV to Map folder
-- Uploads .CSV and maps the tags
-- Checks for any outstanding issues
-- Sends out Campaign status report
--- Goes to internal campaign team
-- Marks campaign as live
-- Refreshes page, campaign disappears from dashboard (pending section)
- Starts with another campaign



# Additional questions
________________________________________________________________
-- Once things are automated in Insight, delivery reports go away?
-- Instead of creating daily reports, CM's link MediaMind campaign to Insight when creating the campaign in MediaMind
- Need to learn more about creating/generating/parsing tags
- difference between DFA and DFP, DSP
