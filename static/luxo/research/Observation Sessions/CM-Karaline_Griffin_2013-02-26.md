# Observation Session
- February 26, 2013
- Karaline Griffin (CM) (Session 1)
- Conducted by Dave Castleton


# Take-aways
________________________________________________________________
- "Dashboard really controls my path for the day."
- "If something gets screwed up, the first thing we do is check what we sent."
- CM's would benefit from having a central location with:
-- Campaigns scheduled to launch the previous day, today, tomorrow
-- Placement issues (no delivery for live campaigns, delivery for pending campaigns, etc.)
-- I.O.'s processed that were assigned to CM
- Need to look at viewable space for mapping (see /product-design/insight/01-discovery/Observation Sessions/Artifacts/Screenshots/Insight/Mapping_screen_from_CM_laptop.png)


# General observations
________________________________________________________________

## Status meeting
- Everybody can ask questions, give/get updates, help out where we can
- Will use the dashboard to go through campaigns in status meetings

## MMS Dashboard
- Doesn't often go down to the live section of the dash
- Spends most of her time in the pending section

## Placement color tags
- Loves the tags in the campaign details page for placements 
(/product-design/insight/01-discovery/Observation Sessions/Artifacts/Screenshots/MMS/06_MMS_placement_status_tag.png)
-- Likes the color coding and being able indicate the status of the placement with the color tags

## Supplemental reports
- Steve's team (Midwest) has a Google spreadsheet that shows campaign progress (includes to-do-lists for team, upcoming campaigns, current=running businesses, upcoming campaigns=pending)
- Karaline likes to know what kinds of campaigns are coming up
-- This information isn't in MMS
-- Helps her plan the upcoming weeks

## Placement screenshots
- Client always asks for screenshots
- Site will send shots of each placement 
- AC will create Centro specific PowerPoint doc that they compile and send to client for verification purposes


# Task observations
________________________________________________________________

## Starting the day
- Checks email
-- If there are live campaigns with issues, she would take care of that first
- Checks for tags for creative that is about to launch
- Sorts inbox by subject to see the string of email replies related to the same subject in a row

- Goes into "Transis" (MMS) Dashboard
-- Sorts by start date to see upcoming campaigns
-- Is there missing creative for campaigns that are launching today or this week?
- Looks for notes on what she needs to map for today
-- Karaline uses notes a lot to add supplemental status notes for herself and others to see
- After she traffics a campaign, sends out (report), clicks on creative, then adds mapping date note in the comments section
- Likes to keep campaign specific notes in MMS
-- If she was sick, others will know the status of a campaign
-- Puts notes in there so others will know that she is aware of status (e.g. waiting for creative)
- She uses notes a lot to keep track of what she needs to do next
-- Can see this in the campaign details page but puts this note here so she/others can see status of the campaign on the dashboard without having to click on the campaign for details

- "Dashboard really controls my path for the day."
- Always check this out first because it really is a road map
-- Will check before status meeting everyday



## Mapping
- First priority in the morning
- Looks at the Daily Bugle Report (see GitHub /product-design/insight/01-discovery/Observation Sessions/Artifacts/Documents/Karaline/Daily Bugle Email - Karaline Griffin.pdf)
-- Usually only looks at "Live Placements Without Delivery" report
- Highlights campaigns that need attention,
- Doesn't look at Creative issues report
-- Usually already knows about info in that report
- Likes that this report gives her a high-level view of what's going on with all her campaigns


## Create a campaign daily report
- Sometimes forgets to set up PointRoll reports to be sent to raw.reports@centro.net
-- CA's will email her and reminder to set up the report 
- Opens tab with PointRoll dashboard
- Creates a daily report


## Initial Daily Reports
- Goes through this process by campaign (v. by step in the process)
-- Helps to make sure she doesn't miss anything in the process for each campaign
- One of the main jobs is to make sure all placements are live once the flight dates have started
- The next day after it's supposed to start, they will start checking to make sure it's live
- Will send emails out to site 
----->
- She receives an email from a publisher saying they never received tags for a particular campaign
- She Searches "Sent" folder to find the email that she sent previously and resends it
<-----
- Goes back to initial report task:
- Pulls report from ad server (PointRoll in this case)
- Opens campaign details pages in new tab
- Keeping DB open in the original tab
- Maps report
- Creates daily report
- Saves report to a temporary "Reports" folder
- Goes to MMS
- Clicks upload
-- Like MMS mapping better
-- She can see more in MMS

## Mapping:
- Looks first at placement name then looks at tags to find match 
-- Looks at name, sizes of ads 
-- Only looks at impression to see if it's live
--- This helps determine if a tag is just a test impression or if it's a live tag performing poorly or
-- Tags with test impression may be for future flight dates
-- Doesn't want to delete those because she might need it later
--- That's why we temporarily hide v. delete tags
-- Test impressions are a visual cue about what's coming up

- Runs into a problem with a tag that she's unfamiliar with
-- Goes to look up the email that she sent the publisher with the tags in it
-- Looks at the attachments to see what was sent and compares that to the mapping panel in MMS
-- Sees that the tag was there and figured out that it's an added value
-- The usual visual cue (AV) wasn't in the tag name

- "If something gets screwed up, the first thing we do is check what we sent."

# Insight feedback
________________________________________________________________
- Doesn't use Insight like a dashboard right now
-- Only uses it to do mapping, auto mapping isn't always accurate 
- Didn't realize that the Insight dashboard (Campaign Index) was displaying ALL campaigns
- Never needs a view of all campaigns
- The viewable space for mapping is Insight is just too small
-- Mapping is really important, should be it's own page

## Create a campaign daily report on an unfamiliar ad server
- Sometimes has to reference the help manual for how to create an delivery report for ad servers she doesn't interact with very much (this is the manual process we hope to eliminate)
- She navigates to the Word doc file on her computer
- Opens Word doc, looks for ad server instructions and follows the screenshots/instructions on how to create a report
