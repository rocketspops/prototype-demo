# General observations
________________________________________________________________

## MediaMind
- MediaMind is down today
- Can't update campaigns that launched yesterday



# Task observations
________________________________________________________________

## User-entered data (Sprint for Digitas) SPRINTDIG004
- Running through Phluent (mobile ad server) for mobile
- Running other on Atlas (ad server)
- Client wants to run all reporting through Atlas
- Some mobile sites can't run double tracking
- So we have to manually add the data for mobile sites that can't handle double tracking
- Can track clicks through Atlas, just not impression
- When he loads up the report, only clicks show on some placements
- He will manually enter the impressions 
-- Phluent is sending the data for this once a week
- Hasn't marked this campaign live due to other roadblocks
- Opens Excel file
- Hides clicks (doesn't need them because we can track that)
- Picks CVSLA placements, sorts by day
- Sums up all the impressions and will enter that in user-enter data in MMS
- Sets the date (no date picker, "date picker would be helpful")

- What do we do with multiple data sources for one placement? In terms of update notices? 
-- Any placement that involved multiple ad sizes in it could also have this situation
-- Placements with multiple sizes could potential serve different sizes from different ad servers giving you multiple data sources for one placement

## Placement management window
- Post user-entered data
- Unmap all tags for a placement
- Can also enter negative impressions to adjust for a discrepancy 
-- If a site messes up, we could reset the delivery this way
-- Add the negative impressions to take away the messed up impressions
-- If they didn't have this, they would have to rebuild the entire campaign
- Be nice to see whom last updated user-entered data and when


## Pro bono campaign - QA for creative assets
- Gets the creative
- IO hasn't come through but he can QA creative to make sure it's all good
- Sent a Dropbox link 
- Sean goes to DB and downloads creative
- SWF file isn't to spec
-- Too large, no border, too many loops, over 15 secs
-- Will need to send to Creative to fix things
-- If we don't have certain assets (e.g. fonts), he will contact agency to get missing assets 
- Downloads FLA and other files from DB
- IO hasn't gone through yet so there isn't any time pressure yet
-- Doesn't know when this campaign launches
-- Just doing pre-campaign due diligence 
- Sends creative to AdValidation
- Nothing passed (all files are over size limit of 40k)
-- Required click tag is missing
- Sends creative assets to Centro Creative team with list of what needs to be done to get the files up to spec
- ClickTags are specific to ad server the creative is running on


## Details design feedback
- That's awesome
- Should be able to copy and paste campaign name and ID 
- Rare to email just one person
-- Is it possible to click "Account team" to email everyone?
- Need to see rolls
-- I know rolls of people on my team, but if I'm covering for someone, I don't always know who does what
