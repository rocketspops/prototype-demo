# Observation Session
- February 19, 2013
- Darcy Johanson
- Conducted by Dave Castleton


# Take-aways
________________________________________________________________
-- Uses personal notes that others don't need to see
-- Basecamp-style commenting w/ email notifications would cut down on time by keeping a record of all correspondence in one place
-- Excel -> .CSV conversion for MediaMind has got to go



# General observations
________________________________________________________________
-- CA started December 2012

-- CA's use are constantly switching between multiple systems/programs (MMS, Email, Excel, Ad Servers, Pentaho) with a lot of data/content to complete tasks

-- 100-130% is good pacing, will send update for any campaign pacing under 100% and ask for increase

-- Manages around 50 campaigns

-- Update around 10-15 campaigns a day

-- Each campaign gets updated about once a week, unless performing poorly or about to end, then updated more often

-- Likes being able to see team members/roles in MMS, helps when sending emails to make sure the right people are included
- Can see initials of each person under heading for the role

-- Teams usually meet once a week
- Daily emails, IM chats for questions and issues that come up

-- % of MediaMind/DART campaigns depends on clients, region, and other factors

-- MMS serves as a high level dashboard
- CA's use spreadsheets to see more detailed information
- When analyzing a campaign, CA will use export a report to Excel and use the spreadsheet

# Feature requests from participant
-- (MMS/Dashboard) Nice to see campaign end date AND end date of the next flight
- Sometimes there are gaps between flights, it would be good to see those

-- CA sorts by "Next reporting date" but when she refreshes the page, the sort resets
- Asked if the sort could persist after refreshing



# Task observations
________________________________________________________________

# Uploading delivery reports
-- First, checks email to see if anybody has requested action on a particular campaign

-- Then sorts campaigns in MMS to see which ones to update next
- "Next Report Date" is manually entered by her the last time she updated the campaign

-- Updates the campaigns that need to be updated that day

-- Tries to do similar campaigns at once (e.g. updates all of Comcast)
- This cuts down on the number of emails she has to send
- Tries to add all requests into one email if possible

-- Looks for her campaigns in the "Raw Reports" email folder
- 7000+ emails in that folder, every report goes in there 
- CA's search by campaign to find emails that pertain to them

-- Open report (MediaMind reports=Excel spreadsheets)
- Checks to make sure the data is up-to-date
- If data isn't up-to-date, will give to ad server and manually download the report (Today, all DART reports had to be manually downloaded because the Centro account was over it's memory quota)

-- Saves report as a .CSV

-- Goes to MMS, uploads .CSV

-- Sets "Next Report Date"
- CA used date/time from Windows OS to determine what to enter  for "Next Report Date". Adding a date selector popup would help this process

# Updating a campaign/publisher correspondence
-- When sending an update to a publisher, includes a table with data showing problem area (pacing, etc.)
- BCC's reports to "Reports" email so every update is tracked and other team members can reference previous correspondence
- Brand Exchange does not get sent to "Reports"

-- CA needed to get an update on the budget for a campaign
- Emailed certain people on the campaign's team
- Went to personal email to review previous correspondence (long email chain) on the subject (because it was a Brand Exchange campaign, emails don't  get BCC'd to "Reports")

-- Once campaign updates are done, CA will look to see if there are any underperforming campaigns that won't be updated today
- Sorts by pacing in the MMS dashboard (index)
- If an underperforming campaign is found, she might update the campaign to see if there is improvement
- May not send out email to other team members yet
- Early updating is to help catch any early performance problems


-- Usually finishes daily update tasks by noon

# Campaign notes
-- Writes down personal notes in a notebook
- Notes are reminders for her that others don't need to see

-- Writes down various information including:
- Campaign
- Something she's done
- Reminder to do something next (pull a report earlier that usual)
- Track dates of when she contacted an AM/AC to know when to follow up
- If a campaign was recently optimized, will note this so she doesn't send an update to the publisher until some time has passed to see if the optimization has improved pacing

-- Never uses notes in MMS to communicate with others on the team
- Will email/IM directly if needed
- Rarely gets information from other people's notes

-- If someone does leave a note, they usually type their initials at the end

# Mapping
-- Mapping usually happens:
- Beginning of the campaign
- Beginning of a new flight date
- Revised creative

-- Does not happen everyday

-- CM tends to map the first time
- CA helps with subsequent mapping

-- Mapping cues (info used to map tags with campaigns)
- Title, size, impressions, flight dates (in general order)
- Mapping cues depend on each tag, not all tags/campaigns are labeled the same

# Next recommended observations
-- CA campaign analysis 
-- Client reporting (create/distribute)
-- Wrapping a campaign (final reports)
